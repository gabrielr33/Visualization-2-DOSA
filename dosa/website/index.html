        <h1> General:</h1>
        <p>
            This program is the implementation of the method DOSA (Detail to Overview via Selections and Aggregations)
            described in the paper "Multivariate Network Exploration and Presentation. From Detail to Overview via
            Selections and Aggregations" by Stef van den Elzen and Jarke J. van Wijk.<br>
            <br>The paper describes a method to visualize multivariate network data using two juxtaposed coupled views: a
            detail view and a high-level view.
            <br>With the help of selections of interests and aggregation of the selected data points the network data
            can be clearly visualized and studied.

        <h1> Implementation/Usage:</h1>
        <p>
            The UI consists of three interactive views: a filter view, a detail view and a high-level view.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h4>Filter view</h4>
        <p>
            In the filter view, the desired data sets can be loaded into the program. The data consists of monthly
            flight data between European airports (249 airports in total) and ranges from January 2019 to March 2021. By
            default, the data set for January 2019 is selected. The desired data set can be loaded into the program via
            the month slider. The current selections and the high-level graph are retained and updated accordingly.<br>
            In addition, certain days of the week can be selected if only flights at certain times of the week are to be
            displayed.<br>
            <br>It is possible to select which edges are to be displayed. There are three types of edges:<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>within edges: flights between airports within one selection
            <li>between edges: flights between airports in different selections
            <li>background edges: flights between airports, where one airport is in a selection and the second airport
                is not in any selection.
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h4>Detail view</h4>
        <p>
            In the detail view, selections can be drawn on the map and selections can be deleted again in the selection
            tab. The map can be moved and zoomed in and out. To create a new selection the 'drawing mode' must be
            selected. If the drawing mode is selected, it is no longer possible to interact with the map (zooming,
            panning) but selections can be drawn on the visible part of the map.<br>
            <br>It is possible to click anywhere to define the upper left corner of the selection rectangle, move the
            mouse and click again to define the lower right corner of the selection rectangle.
            Once a selection has been created, a separate node is created in the high-level view with the same name and
            color.<br><br>
            As soon as another selection is created, e.g. the between-edges can be selected (if they were not already
            selected before creation) and the high-level graph is updated accordingly.<br>
            <br>
        </p>

        <h4>High-level view</h4>
        <p>
            In the high-level view, the selection data is aggregated and displayed in a directed graph. The selections
            can be moved freely to increase the overview or to personalize the visualization. If the mouse is hovered
            over an edge or node, the corresponding aggregated data (number of flights for edges, number of airports
            within the selection for nodes) are displayed. This data can also be permanently shown or hidden via a
            checkbox.
        </p>

        <h1> Dataset:</h1>
        <p>
            The data set was provided by the website "zenodo" under the entry "Crowdsourced air traffic data from The
            OpenSky Network 2020". <a
                href="https://zenodo.org/record/4737390">(https://zenodo.org/record/4737390)</a><br>
            The data consists of monthly worldwide flight data, for our application we have reduced the data to the
            European data.
